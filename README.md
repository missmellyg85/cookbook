# cookbook

A cookbook app to play around with several technologies and become more familiar with how they can integrate. 

This app uses Spring Boot, MyBatis, PostgreSQL, and Angular 1.4. It is deployed to Heroku.

I'm keeping track on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/7wx7R9WX/development) of new features that come up as I work.
